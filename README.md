🏠 IoT Smart Home System
📘 Overview

The IoT Smart Home project is a simulation built using Cisco Packet Tracer that demonstrates the integration of smart IoT devices for home automation. The project showcases how sensors, actuators, and networking devices communicate through an IoT-enabled network to provide a secure, automated, and energy-efficient environment.

⚙️ Features

🔥 Smart Fire Detection using temperature and flame sensors

💡 Automatic Lighting System controlled by motion sensors

🌡️ Temperature Monitoring with automated fan control

🚪 Smart Door System integrated with motion and proximity sensors

📱 Remote Monitoring & Control using IoT Dashboard in Cisco Packet Tracer

🛰️ Wireless Communication between IoT devices and Home Gateway

🧠 Working Principle

All IoT devices are connected to a central Home Gateway Server that communicates through the IoT Cloud. Each device can be remotely monitored and controlled via the Cisco Packet Tracer IoT interface, simulating real-world smart home automation systems.
